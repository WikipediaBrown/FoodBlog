<p>Welcome to FoodBlog, fellow foodies! My name is Delores Samuels, and I’m excited to share with you one of my all-time favorite recipes: Al Pastor Tacos! If you’re looking for a delicious and easy-to-make meal that’s perfect for any occasion, then look no further. Al Pastor Tacos are a traditional Mexican dish that is packed with flavor and spice, and I’ve found the perfect recipe to recreate this authentic dish from Mexico City.</p>

<p>Al Pastor Tacos are a staple of Mexican street food, and they are incredibly popular throughout Mexico and beyond. The name “al pastor” literally means “shepherd style,” which refers to the way the meat is prepared. Traditionally, al pastor meat is cooked on a vertical spit, similar to the way shawarma or gyro meat is cooked, and then shaved off into thin slices. This style of cooking was brought to Mexico by Lebanese immigrants, and over time it has become an essential part of Mexican cuisine.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get started with this delicious and easy-to-make recipe for Al Pastor Tacos.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>1 pound pork shoulder, sliced thinly
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1/4 cup white vinegar
2 tbsp achiote paste
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tbsp cumin
1 tbsp chili powder
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Corn tortillas
Cilantro, chopped
Onion, diced
Lime wedges
Salsa of your choice
Instructions:</p>

<p>In a large bowl, combine the pineapple juice, white vinegar, achiote paste, oregano, cumin, chili powder, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
Add the thinly sliced pork to the bowl and toss to coat the meat in the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.
Preheat your grill to high heat. If you don’t have a grill, you can also cook the meat on a stovetop or in the oven.
Once the grill is hot, remove the pork from the marinade and discard any excess marinade. Thread the pork onto skewers and grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. If you’re using a stovetop or oven, cook the pork in a skillet or baking dish until cooked through.
Remove the pork from the skewers and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.
Warm up your tortillas on the grill, stovetop, or in the oven. Place a few slices of the al pastor meat onto each tortilla, and top with chopped cilantro and diced onion.
Serve your Al Pastor Tacos with lime wedges and your favorite salsa on the side.
Now, let me share some tips and tricks to make sure your Al Pastor Tacos come out perfectly.</p>

<p>Tip #1: Don’t skip the marinade</p>

<p>The marinade is what gives the pork its signature flavor and tenderness. Make sure you marinate the pork for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight, to let the flavors fully develop.</p>

<p>Tip #2: Use achiote paste</p>

<p>Achiote paste is made from ground annatto seeds, which gives the pork its signature orange-red color. It’s an essential ingredient in this recipe, and you can find it at most Latin grocery stores or online.</p>

<p>Tip #3: Use a meat thermometer</p>

<p>When grilling or cooking the pork, use a meat thermometer to ensure it’s cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F.</p>
