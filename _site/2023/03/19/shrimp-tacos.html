<p>Hello foodies! It’s Delores Samuels again on FoodBlog, and today I’m excited to share with you a mouth-watering recipe for Shrimp Tacos. After sharing my favorite Al Pastor and Carne Asada taco recipes, I wanted to mix it up with some seafood. This recipe is simple, quick, and oh-so-delicious!</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>Corn tortillas</li>
  <li>Cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>Avocado, sliced</li>
  <li>Red onion, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
  <li>Lime wedges</li>
  <li>Chipotle crema (see recipe below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Chipotle Crema Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
  <li>2 tbsp adobo sauce (from canned chipotle peppers)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Instructions:</li>
</ul>

<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add the shrimp to the bowl and toss to coat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp are pink and cooked through.
–Just like in my previous taco recipes, it’s important not to overcook the shrimp. Overcooked shrimp can become tough and rubbery.–</p>

<p>Warm up your tortillas on the skillet or in the oven. Once the tortillas are warm, place a few shrimp onto each tortilla.
Top the shrimp with thinly sliced cabbage, sliced avocado, red onion, and chopped cilantro.
Serve your Shrimp Tacos with a squeeze of lime juice and a dollop of chipotle crema.
To make the chipotle crema, simply whisk together the sour cream, adobo sauce, lime juice, and salt in a small bowl. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</p>

<p>And there you have it, a quick and delicious recipe for Shrimp Tacos. This recipe is perfect for a quick weeknight meal or for entertaining guests. So give it a try and let me know what you think!</p>
