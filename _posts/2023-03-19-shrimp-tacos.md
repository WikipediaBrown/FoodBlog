Hello foodies! It's Delores Samuels again on FoodBlog, and today I'm excited to share with you a mouth-watering recipe for Shrimp Tacos. After sharing my favorite Al Pastor and Carne Asada taco recipes, I wanted to mix it up with some seafood. This recipe is simple, quick, and oh-so-delicious!

Ingredients:

- 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Corn tortillas
- Cabbage, thinly sliced
- Avocado, sliced
- Red onion, thinly sliced
- Cilantro, chopped
- Lime wedges
- Chipotle crema (see recipe below)

Chipotle Crema Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 2 tbsp adobo sauce (from canned chipotle peppers)
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- Salt, to taste
- Instructions:

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add the shrimp to the bowl and toss to coat.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is hot, add the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp are pink and cooked through.
--Just like in my previous taco recipes, it's important not to overcook the shrimp. Overcooked shrimp can become tough and rubbery.--

Warm up your tortillas on the skillet or in the oven. Once the tortillas are warm, place a few shrimp onto each tortilla.
Top the shrimp with thinly sliced cabbage, sliced avocado, red onion, and chopped cilantro.
Serve your Shrimp Tacos with a squeeze of lime juice and a dollop of chipotle crema.
To make the chipotle crema, simply whisk together the sour cream, adobo sauce, lime juice, and salt in a small bowl. Adjust the seasoning to taste.

And there you have it, a quick and delicious recipe for Shrimp Tacos. This recipe is perfect for a quick weeknight meal or for entertaining guests. So give it a try and let me know what you think!
