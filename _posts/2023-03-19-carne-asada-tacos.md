Hola amigos! It's Delores Samuels back again on FoodBlog, and today I'm excited to share with you another one of my favorite taco recipes: Carne Asada Tacos! If you enjoyed my previous post on Al Pastor Tacos, then you're going to love this one too.

Carne Asada is a classic Mexican dish that's perfect for any occasion, whether it's a casual weeknight dinner or a backyard barbecue. It's made with grilled or seared flank steak that's been marinated in a flavorful mixture of citrus, garlic, and spices.

Without further ado, let's dive into the recipe!

Ingredients:

1 lb flank steak
1/4 cup lime juice
1/4 cup orange juice
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp cumin
1 tbsp chili powder
1/2 tsp paprika
Salt and pepper, to taste
Corn tortillas
Cilantro, chopped
Onion, diced
Lime wedges
Salsa of your choice
Instructions:

In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Add the flank steak to the bowl and toss to coat the meat in the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.
--Just like in my previous post, the marinade is crucial for this recipe. It's what gives the meat its delicious flavor and tenderness.--

Preheat your grill to high heat. If you don't have a grill, you can also cook the meat on a stovetop or in the oven.
Once the grill is hot, remove the steak from the marinade and discard any excess marinade. Grill the steak for about 4-6 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.
Remove the steak from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly against the grain.
Warm up your tortillas on the grill, stovetop, or in the oven. Place a few slices of the carne asada onto each tortilla, and top with chopped cilantro and diced onion.
Serve your Carne Asada Tacos with lime wedges and your favorite salsa on the side.
Now, let me share some tips and tricks to make sure your Carne Asada Tacos come out perfectly.

Tip #1: Don't overcook the meat

Flank steak is a lean cut of meat, so it can easily become tough and chewy if overcooked. Keep an eye on the steak while grilling it, and remove it from the grill once it reaches your desired level of doneness.

Tip #2: Slice against the grain

When slicing the steak, be sure to slice against the grain to ensure the meat stays tender and easy to chew.

Tip #3: Customize your toppings

Feel free to get creative with your toppings! You can add sliced avocado, crumbled queso fresco, or even a dollop of sour cream to your tacos for extra flavor and creaminess.

I hope you enjoy this recipe for Carne Asada Tacos! It's a classic Mexican dish that's perfect for any occasion, and I'm sure it will become a favorite in your household. Hasta luego!
